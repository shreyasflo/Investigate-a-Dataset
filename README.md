I conducted my own data analysis and created a file to share that documents your findings. I started by taking a look at my dataset and brainstorming what questions I  could answer using it. I chose the Lahman Baseball Dataset (http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/), as the dataset for my analysis. Then I used Pandas and NumPy to answer the questions I was most interested in, and created a report sharing the answers.
